# gRPC-WS-Example
This is the gRPC equivalent of the RESTful WS example, meant to illustrate the difference between generic interfaces (i.e., RESTful) and application-specific interfaces.

See here for instructions on how to install gRPC and compile the interface specification (.proto): https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/
